System config
- Centos 6.5
Centos can running in Vagrant/VM/Cloud, setting PostgreSQL directory port number and database cluster separately wth 3 instance.
>Master
>Replica1
>Replica2

- PostgreSQL 9.4.*
- Haproxy 1.5.*

Test scenarios
1. First, initialize the first in a PostgreSQL of the master instance, to start.
2. Next 3 instance worth a replica, to be started in asynchronous replication configuration.
3. In three replica of activating the HAProxy to spread the load.
4. Tables required by pgbench on the master, to create the data.
5. Through HAProxy, run the SELECT Only of pgbench.
6. pgbench during the run, bring down one of the replica (the second replica of the in the demo).
7. HAProxy are sure that you are removed from the target of load balancing by detecting the failure.
8. And re-set up a replica that was down, to return to HAProxy.
9. The return replica HAProxy starts flowing again transaction is detected.
